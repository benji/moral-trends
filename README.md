# Moral Trends

A simple visual representation of Gallup's historical data:

"I'm going to read you a list of issues. Regardless of whether or not you think it should be legal, for each one, please tell me whether you personally believe that in general it is morally acceptable or morally wrong."

### Data Processing

The graphs show the portion of "Morally acceptable" (green), "Morally wrong" (red) and "Depends" (grey).

The "No opinion" and "Depends" statistics have been merged into "Other" on the graphs.
